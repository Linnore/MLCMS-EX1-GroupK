## Machine Learning in Crowd Modelling and Simulation, Exercise 1, Group K

### To launch our GUI:
  python main.py
  
### To see how we visualize the results for RiMEA tests:
  Please go to corresponding folders (e.g. RiMEA_test4_plot). 
  Some short scripts will be there.


### Be careful with the working directory! Our GUI may output some results for RiMEA tests into txt files!
